## Content Insights
From the content I learned a large variety of knwoledge and skills that can greatly complement the skills of a web developer, teamworking skills such as what communication software should be used,  how to use github and how to use trello is among some of the teamworking software that my group will be using, all of them able to be integrated with one another to incerase the productivity of the group as well as to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the group when doing projects, with this the group should be able to work together to complete a project with much better efficiency than groups without. For this project we are using Slack, Trello, and Github as our teamworking tools, Github and Trello can both be integrated into Slack, where Slack is a communication platform for development teams who wish to integrate their other teamwork tools as well. This dramatically increases the efficiency of my team's productivity
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
The things that I have elarned this week will be extremely important to me when I graduate to find a job, the ability and skill to work cohesively in a team is a highly sought after and desirable skill amongst employers, no man is an island is a saying that applies to any employee in any company, this means that teamwork and groupwork is something that must be learned by any prospective graduate looking for a job. Thus the ability to work with teamworking tools and work with group development methods is something that is extremely beneficial to my employability.
