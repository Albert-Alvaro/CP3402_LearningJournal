## Estimated Hours

This week I had spent 7 hours on CMS

## Goal

The goal of this practical is to obtain a more stable foundation through learneing using the scientific method, and also to further gain skills in theme creation

## SMART Goals

* Specific
Must be able to use the scientific method and basic competence in theme creeation
* Measured
Must be able to use the 4 steps of the scientific method and know the various files and functions associated with a WordPress theme
* Achieveable
Be able to explain the scientific method and the functions that goes into a theme in WordPress
* Relevant
The scientific methoid is the most widely used and foundational method of study and learning in the world, learning and knowing of it is a must.
* Time Bound
Finish before the week 10 practical

## Content Insights
This week I had gleaned a myriad of things from the lecture and the slides. Theme creation in WordPress is something that deeply involves coding and will make full use of the PHP skills which has just been acquired as recently as the last week, this is an extremely fgood way of not only becoming more proficient in PHP but also becoming more familiar with how WordPress uses themes to handle the layout of their dynamically changing widgets and variables.
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
The insights which I have learned this week has also increased my employability in the IT sector, while not as widely used as in other fields, IT is still a field of science and will make use of the sceientific method to conduct some for of study that will benefit the greater IT community as a whole. Furthermore the ability to edit and modify WordPress themes on the fly is extremely valuable and is something that companies desires when looking for new employees.

## Learning with the Scientific Mehtod

Steps include, observation, generating a problem statement from data gatherd during observation, forming a hypothesis, experimentation with said hypothesis, and conclusion.

### Observation
I observed that there are a lot of learnign avenues which I might be missingcas I typically only search from Youtube
### Porblem Statement
I have a narrow source of learning content
### Hypothesis
My narrow source of learning content might be hindering me from actually learning as much as I possibly can.
### Experiment
I will search the same thing on both Youtube and Google to see what results I will get for both, I will then report back how many results I had gotten for both and what was the quality of the information in either source.
Youtube results:

Google results:

As can be seen, the results from youtube were of a higher quality but the sheer quantity of results from Google makes it a statistical fact that in onve of thsoe results is osmthing that youa re looking for. Hoever Youtube's quality of information is generally much huigher than that of Google searchs
### Conclusion
The conlcusion I came to is that whilst Google searches will prompt more quantity, Youtube searches will prompt more quality information in the form of tutorial videos. Both have their negatives and positives, but in the end I can safely say that the usage of both interchangeably is the aest course of action
