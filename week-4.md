# Week 4

## Learning Activities & Resources
  This week has been a productive and fruitful one as I have learned mnore regarding what in my opinion is a basic skill any web developer should have, which is being able to host and develop a website locally. During this week's practical session, the teacher had taught hus how to create a local Apache and MySQL database server using a software called XAMPP, this is necessary for developing websites locally without connecting to the internet, as with these local servers running I am able to locally run WordPress on my computer without having to be connected to the internet with my progress saved unto the database which I have created as well. Furthermore I have been gaining and earning insights on my own as well as I have watched tutorial videos on how to run both Joomla and Wordpress utilizing XAMPP.

## Estimated Hours
This week I approxiamtely spent 8 hours on CMS

## Goal
The goal of creating a localhost server on a computer using XAMPP is to gain the ability to work and develop a website using a content management system without having to be connected to the internet. This is a powerful ability as being able to work on a website without having to rely on an internet connection would mean that you can develop your website anywhere for as long as you have your computer with you, furthermore this also allows for a more direct experience with editing not only the database but the files of a website as well if you so desire.

## SMART Goals

* Specific
I must be able to configure and use XAMPP to run a website which I have created on an internet website hosting service. This requires me to be able to export the files and somehow configure them in such a way that they will be readable to the WordPress version I have running locally on my computer.
* Measured
I should be able to edit and customize my imported website locally with just as much ease as when I was editing and customizing my site when it was hosted on a hosting service over the internet.
* Achieveable
I should watch tutorial videos on how to do such a thing and take notes of the steps which they have taken, my process will be step by step as I follow along with the tutorial I found or I will have to create my won step by step process as the tutorials which can lead me to achieving my goal might be scattered across several different videos each explaining different things which are necessary for achieving my overall end goal
* Relevant
Having a localhost instance of your website that can be edited and managed using a content management system not only allows for far greater flexibility in regards to when you can continue to work on and develop it but it will also allow for a web developer to have far greater control of the website as they will be able to customize more ffeatures of the content management system and they will be able to have greater ccontrol of the backend processes which goes into ensuring that a website is able to be accessed on the interneet as well.
* Time Bound
I should complete the configuration of XAMPP and be able to run WordPress and my website managed by WordPress as well.

## Content Insights
I have gained a myriad of insight throught he practical this week, throguh learning how to utilize XAMPP, I am now able to create a local server using my computer's resources, this will allow me to further work on learning how to do serverside work, moreover I ahd already learned how to host a WordPress instance using the locally run servers mentioned before, which is somehting that I will further work on to gain even more insight regarding the process on how each work. I have also gained further knowledge on just what is necessary for true enterprise web development throguh this experience.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I have gained much this week that increase the career prospects I possess as well as my employability. Being able to run a locally hsoted server as well as knwoing what to do to fully utilize such an instance is a valuable skill that any employer will be on the lookout for. Moreover I had also learned how to locally hust an instance of WordPress on the aforementioned local servers, which is another skill that highly increases my employability. This experience has taught how to do web development as someone doing it for an enterprise would do, which is a skill and experience which will greatly improve my career prospects.
