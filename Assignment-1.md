The two websites that I have created are built utilizing 2 different content management systems, WordPress and Joomla 5. The first website I had created used Joomla 5, it is a website meant for Varo Digital Solutions, and is thus focused for helping clintele who finds themselves with issues regarding matters related to digital and technology, thus the design of my website also reflects this with being easy to navigate and simple in design. The website I had created using WordPress is for Varo Financial Consultancy, the subsidiary which is focused and specialized with assistance in financial issues. The goal of this segmentation is for the company to obtain the ability to specifically target demographics that they are able to provide service towards, as different demographics require different approcahes for marketing. Thus the main goal of creating 2 websites is to be able to cater towards specific demographics.
