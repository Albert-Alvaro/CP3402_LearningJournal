## Websites Description

One of the subsidiaries is catered towards those seekling solutions for their digital and technological problems, the subsidiary is named Varo Digital Solutions. The other subsidiary is focused and specialized in helpng cliebnts who require assistance with financial matters, the subsidiary is named Varo Financial Consultancy.

The two websites that I have created are built utilizing 2 different content management systems, WordPress and Joomla 5. The first website I had created used Joomla 5, it is a website meant for Varo Digital Solutions, and is thus focused for helping clintele who finds themselves with issues regarding matters related to digital and technology, thus the design of my website also reflects this with being easy to navigate and simple in design. The website I had created using WordPress is for Varo Financial Consultancy, the subsidiary which is focused and specialized with assistance in financial issues. The goal of this segmentation is for the company to obtain the ability to specifically target demographics that they are able to provide service towards, as different demographics require different approcahes for marketing. Thus the main goal of creating 2 websites is to be able to cater towards specific demographics.

## Learning Activity and Resources
For the assignemnt I had utilized a variety of resources to figure out how to do the things which I wished to do for my website. I had read several documentations regarding some of the functionalities for Joomla 5 and WordPress to better understand them and had revisited videos as well to refresh my understanding of both of these content management systems.

## Content Insights
For this assignment I had done various things that had allowed me to learn a myriad of features that my previous practicals could not teach me regarding the 2 content managemnet systems which I have been using. For the Joomla 5 website I had installed a template for my website and had learned the variety of features which a template can bring to a Joomla website in terms of customization of the design and layout of a website, furthermore I had also installed several modules for Joomla 5 which I had to learn how to use as each module possesses it's own unique user interface as well as features, an example would be the form creation extension that I had used which I had used to create the contact form present in my Joomla website, the progress bar module which I had installed to showcase my company's values in the home page, and many more. For WordPress I had learned a myriad of things as well when I created my website, I learned even more how the post system in WordPress worked as I had never had the need nor want to utilize that feature beforehand, thus through the process of creating the website for Varo Financial Consultancy, I had learned how posts function, I had also learned to further utlize the plugins of WordPress as well.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

This assignemnt has dramtically increased my employability value, I have gained a myriad of knowledge in regards to the various functionalities of both WordPress and Joomla 5, allowing me to skillfully and proficientlly create websites on the fly, not only that but my experience with hosting services has also increased as well as there were some hosting issues which I had to resolve throguh my own research and trial and error. Moreover I had not only learned mroe throught he content management systems, but through creating the content of each website, I had also learned how to do rudimentary marketing for a company towarsd specific target demographics, I have learned how to maximize the services which a company can provide, and I had learned how to create website designs which will be well received by specific target audiences. This has granted me the ability to create websites specifically for marketing towards a speicifc clientele, a valuable ability for any web developer to have as the current industry is filled with demand for a web develoer to have skills other than web development, skills such as business acumen, marketing skills, and design skills.
