## Content Insights
This week i gained new insights into a software which I have not used before, content management systems such as Joomla and Wordpress are software which I have not used before. Thus it has been a learning experience in delving deep and discovering the features of Joomla through either my own experimentation with the software and also through youtube video tutorials. It has shown me the convenienvce and efficiency of the usage of such a software for website development and design.

The website has the goal of attracting customers and clients through the use of personally designed graphics and letting the customer build more trust with our company. Furthermore the website is also meant as a gateway for potential clients and customers to contact us through our websites contact us page. Moreover it also has the information necessary to inform our potential clients and customers on what we do and inform them that we are certainly the best choice.

Here are the various aspects of our website as defined by STP or Segmentation, Targeting, and Positioning:
* Segmentation : Our company does segmentation, which means to divide the services which our company provides into specific segments by identifying different customer needs. Our customers are divided into people who wish to seek IT help, people who wish to seek Cybersecurity help. and people who wish to seek IoT help. Our services reflect this as we also have specific service categories that cater towards these customer segments
